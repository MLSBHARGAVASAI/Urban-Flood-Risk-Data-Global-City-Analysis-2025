# 🌊 Urban Flood Risk Data: Global City Analysis 2025

## 📌 Project Overview  
Urban flooding is one of the most pressing global risks, driven by **climate change, rapid urbanization, and inadequate drainage systems**.  

This project uses the **[Urban Flood Risk Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pratyushpuri/urban-flood-risk-data-global-city-analysis-2025/data)** to analyze **flood risk across 63 global cities**.  

The dataset contains **2,963 urban segments** with attributes such as:  
- 🌍 **Geography** → City, ward, latitude, longitude  
- 🏞️ **Topography** → Elevation, DEM source  
- 🏘️ **Land use & soil type**  
- 🚰 **Drainage infrastructure** → density, proximity, type  
- 🌧️ **Rainfall data** → source, intensity, return period  
- ⚠️ **Risk labels** → ponding hotspots, low-lying areas, sparse drainage, extreme rainfall events  

**Objective:**  
To identify **high-risk urban segments** and uncover **patterns of vulnerability** that can guide **climate resilience & disaster management strategies**.

## 📊 Problem Statement  
Urban flooding is an escalating threat worldwide.  
The aim of this project is to **analyze and visualize urban flood risk patterns** by answering:  

1. Which cities and neighborhoods are most vulnerable?  
2. How do elevation, land use, soil, and drainage affect flood risk?  
3. What historical rainfall trends and multi-label risk factors emerge?  

This Week 1 project focuses on **data understanding and exploratory analysis**, laying the foundation for **predictive modeling** in later stages.

## 🛠️ Steps Completed (Week 1)  

### 1. Import Libraries  
- Pandas, NumPy (data handling)  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly (visualization)  

### 2. Load Dataset  
```python
df = pd.read_excel('/content/urban_pluvial_flood_risk_dataset.xlsx')
. Dataset Overview

Shape: (2963, 17)

Unique Cities: 63

Example Cities: Colombo 🇱🇰, Chennai 🇮🇳, Hong Kong 🇨🇳, Durban 🇿🇦

4. Dataset Info

Checked data types, non-null counts, and memory usage.

5. Summary Statistics

Elevation: -3m (below sea level) to 266m

Rainfall intensity: avg 43.8 mm/hr

Drainage density: avg 6.3 km/km²

6. Missing Values
missing = df.isnull().sum().sort_values(ascending=False)
missing_percent = (missing / len(df)) * 100
pd.DataFrame({'Missing Values': missing, 'Percentage (%)': missing_percent})


Soil Group → 12.2% missing

Rainfall Source → 10.6% missing

Drainage Density → 9.6% missing

Storm Drain Type → 6.0% missing

7. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

✅ Top 10 Cities with Most Segments → Manila, San Francisco, Philadelphia, Rotterdam, Athens…
✅ Elevation Distribution → Most areas between 0–100m, some below sea level.
✅ Land Use Distribution → Residential (27.9%), Roads (20.2%), Commercial (16.6%).
✅ Risk Labels Frequency → ponding_hotspot, low_lying, sparse_drainage are dominant tags.

8. Correlation Analysis

A heatmap of numeric features was generated.

Key findings:

Elevation ⬆️ → Flood Risk ⬇️ (negative correlation)

Rainfall Intensity ⬆️ → Flood Risk ⬆️ (positive correlation)

Storm Drain Proximity (higher distance) → Flood Risk ⬆️

Drainage Density (higher) → Flood Risk ⬇️

This confirms that low elevation, sparse drainage, and high rainfall intensity are strong drivers of flooding risk.
